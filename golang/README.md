This is intended for use with Iximiuz labs challenges. It exposes a default route on port 8000, as well as a metrics endpoint for prometheus to scrape on port 5000.

It includes `curl` so that you can test out sending network traffic from it to confirm whether appropriate network policies have been configured.
